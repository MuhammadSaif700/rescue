# RescueEye Global

Emergency reporting and disaster information platform for communities.

## What is this?

RescueEye Global helps people report emergencies and check weather/disaster conditions in their area. I built this because during emergencies, it's hard to get quick, reliable information about what's happening around you.

## Features

- Report emergencies on an interactive map
- Check weather and disaster alerts for any location
- Chat with an AI assistant for weather questions
- Get emergency preparedness recommendations

## How to run it

You need Node.js and Python installed.

**Backend server:**

```bash
cd server
node index.js
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

**AI Chat (optional):**

```bash
cd chat
python weatherbot_client.py
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Tech stack

**Frontend:**

- React.js for the UI
- Leaflet.js for maps

- Node.js with Express
- JSON files for data storage

**APIs used:**
